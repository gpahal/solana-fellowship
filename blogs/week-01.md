# Week 1: Getting started

This week's goal was brushing up on Rust concepts and getting started with Solana's programming model and tooling.

The week started with a talk by [Chase](https://twitter.com/therealchaseeb) who works at Solana in developer relations.
He talked about the Solana ecosystem, the kind of growth they saw over the last year especially from India and where he
sees it going from here. A lot to be optimistic and excited about! Do follow him to keep up with the ecosystem and to
learn how to get started with Solana. Also checkout [SOL dev_](https://soldev.app/) for everything you might need for
Solana development.

We also got to know more about the fellowship, it's structure and goals from [Neil](https://twitter.com/neilshroff) and
[Gnana Lakshmi](https://twitter.com/gyanlakshmi).

## Solana

Last week I read
[Explaining Solana with The Simpsons](https://learn.figment.io/tutorials/explaining-solana-with-the-simpsons). It's one
of the best introductions to Solana and it's innovations that I have come across till date. I had gone through the
official blog posts written by Solana devs to understand why it's so fast and secure, but they were a bit difficult to
grasp for me. But after reading this post, it started to make sense. Kudos to the
[Jonathan Ferreira](https://twitter.com/JSoufer) for putting it together. 

This week was about learning the [programming model](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/overview),
[how to deploy to Solana](https://openquest.xyz/quest/deploying-the-program-on-to-solana) and [how to work with
interfaces to Solana like the spl token cli](https://openquest.xyz/quest/create_crypto_with_solana_cli). It was a fun
experience to actually use the technologies that you read about and see how such are made and deployed.

Looking forward to diving deeper into the ecosystem in the coming weeks and most importantly shipping cool stuff!
