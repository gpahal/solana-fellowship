# Solana Fellowship

Solana Fellowship is an 8-week hands-on program to learn, earn and build on Solana. I was a part of it in 2022. This
repository contains all the things - quests, exercises - I worked on during that time.

I documented my updates and learnings early. They are available in this repository but you can read them on my blog -
[Solana Fellowship](https://garvitpahal.com/blog/solana-fellowship).

I worked on a real-tim streaming payments project - **Superstream** - during and after the fellowship. Check out the
webite of [Superstream](https://superstream.finance/)
